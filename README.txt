Short Description: Publish AI-written content directly from WordPress, using your own OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or Perplexity keys. No subscriptions. No surprises. You pay for exactly what you get.


== Description ==

WP-AutoInsight brings AI content generation into your WordPress dashboard without a platform subscription attached. It isn't a SaaS or another subscription service. You pay for what you use. Connect your OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Perplexity accounts to the plugin, and your site will generate content at low cost, for a fraction of what most SaaS tools charge $50-100 per month.

Whether you're a small business keeping a blog active, an agency managing content for clients, or a blogger who'd rather talk through ideas than type them, WP-AutoInsight creates, you review, and *you* publish.

= Key Features =

* **Generate content in more ways than you'd expect**
  - Write full blog posts from a keyword list, automatically or on demand
  - Turn voice notes or meeting recordings into draft posts. Upload audio, get a structured article
  - Create infographics from any existing post, saved directly to your Media Library
  - Pull research-backed content through Perplexity Sonar, complete with clickable source citations

* **Choose the AI. Pay the AI directly.**
  - Supports OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and Perplexity models. Switch models anytime you want
  - Each model shows an estimated cost per post before you choose it
  - Your API keys, their actual rates. No markup, no lock-in

* **Nothing publishes without your approval**
  - Content saves as a draft by default. Review before anything goes live
  - Content History tracks every generated post: which model, which status, when
  - Set tone, keywords, categories, and length once. The plugin will follow your rules

* **Works with everything already on your site**
  - Native Gutenberg block output. Not an HTML blob in a classic editor
  - Yoast SEO and RankMath: focus keywords, meta descriptions, and social excerpts generated automatically
  - Featured images via DALL-E 3, Stability AI, or Gemini image generation

* **For developers**
  - Store API keys in wp-config.php for maximum security, or use WordPress 7.0's native Connectors API

== Changelog ==

= 3.8.0 =
* Added:
  - **Provider Registry**: Centralized provider metadata for OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and Stability AI. Model availability, credential mapping, and connection testing now come from one registry instead of scattered conditionals.
  - **Versioned Settings Schema**: Settings now migrate through a schema-driven upgrade path. Existing API keys, keyword groups, templates, and selected models are preserved during upgrades, with a confirmation notice after migration.
  - **Capability Helpers**: Text generation, image generation, citations, and audio transcription support are now resolved through explicit provider capabilities rather than model-name heuristics.
  - **Regression Test Suite**: Added focused PHP regression coverage for provider routing, credential resolution, settings migration, generation payload persistence, SEO parsing, image alt text, and AJAX hook registration.
* Updated:
  - Credential resolution, provider selection, and image-service fallback logic now use the shared registry and settings layer.
  - Admin and onboarding flows now save and validate provider settings through the schema-backed settings API.
  - Upgrade messaging now confirms when settings have been migrated successfully.
* Fixed:
  - API key validation no longer reports false-positive success states when a provider test fails.

= 3.7.0 =
* Added:
  - **Background Generation Jobs**: Manual, scheduled, bulk, and regenerate flows now create queued jobs that run through WordPress' default WP-Cron mechanism instead of blocking the admin request.
  - **Live Generation Log**: Content History is now a full job log with status, source, model, keywords, template, created time, runtime, and result or error details.
  - **Generation Log Controls**: Added a status filter, a "Refresh now" button, and an auto-refresh toggle so you can monitor jobs without reloading the page.
  - **Faster Error Handling**: Failed jobs now include a "Copy error" action and a direct "Report this error" link for quick support requests.
* Updated:
  - **Manual and Bulk UX**: Manual generation, regenerate, and bulk generation now queue immediately and update their status live while jobs run in the background.
  - **Generation Results**: Successful jobs now include direct Edit and View links from the log for faster follow-up actions.

= 3.6.0 =
* Added:
  - **WordPress 7.0 Connectors Support**: Native integration with the new Settings → Connectors screen in WordPress 7.0. If your site already has API keys configured there, the plugin detects and uses them automatically — no re-entry needed. Advanced Settings now shows three states per provider: set in wp-config.php, managed by WordPress Connectors, or editable manually. On WordPress 6.x the plugin works identically to v3.5.
  - **Bulk Generation**: Generate multiple posts at once from a keyword list. Paste keywords (one per line) or upload a .txt file, select a template and model, and the plugin generates each post sequentially as a draft. Progress is shown live as it runs. This replaces a workflow that SaaS autoblogging tools charge $99/month for.
  - **User Permissions panel**: Advanced Settings now includes a read-only panel showing whether your account has AI generation permission, with an explanation of how WordPress 7.0's native `prompt_ai` capability works.
* Updated:
  - Admin panel rebuilt into modular tab partials. Each settings tab is now a separate file under `includes/admin/`. No visible change for users, *but* as the plugin keeps growing, I'm trying to make the structure easier to modify, for v4.0 interface redesign.
* Fixed:
  - Fixed minor bugs and improved overall stability.
= 3.5.0 =
* Added:
  - **RankMath SEO Support**: Full integration with RankMath SEO. Automatically generates focus keywords (comma-separated list), meta descriptions, and social excerpts.
  - **Keyword Groups**: Organize your content strategy with named groups. Each group can target a specific category and use a custom template. Scheduled generation now rotates through these groups.
  - **Content Templates**: Create and manage multiple prompt templates. Use placeholders like `{keywords}`, `{title}`, `{tone}`, `{site_name}`, and `{category}` to customize how AI generates your content.
  - **Advanced Generation Log**: Upgraded content history with "Regenerate" capability. Re-run any previous generation with its original parameters in one click.
  - **Meta Box Consolidation**: Improved codebase health by consolidating all post-edit tools into a single, efficient registration system.
* Updated:
  - Improved RankMath detection and field mapping.
  - Contextual tooltips now cover Content Length, Scheduling Frequency, and AI Model selection.
  - Spinner and status feedback in Create AI Post and Regenerate Post now use the shared `abcc-ui.js` component instead of inline browser alerts.
* Fixed some minor bugs and QoL updates
